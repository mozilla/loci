# Loci

Loci is greek for "places". The word is also used in Sherlock Holmes' memory technique, the method of loci a.k.a. the mind palace technique.

The main goal of this project is to prototype full-text search storage and retrieval in gecko.
To achieve our goal, we are implementing the background job infrastructure in this project, and this infrastructure will be re-used in [Activity Stream](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream) to collect all local metadata.
